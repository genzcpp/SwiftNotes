1. **Named Parameters in Closures**  
  - Swift allows parameter names inside a closure but does **not**  support external argument labels when calling a closure.
 
  - Example:

```swift
let driving = { (place: String) in
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
driving("Los Angeles") // ✅ Works
```
 
  - ❌ `driving(place: "Los Angeles")` does **not**  work because closures don’t support external labels.
 
2. **Workarounds for Named Parameters in Closures**  
  - **Wrap the closure in a function** :

```swift
func drive(to place: String) {
    print("I'm going to \(place) in my car")
}
drive(to: "Los Angeles") // ✅ Works
```
 
  - **Use a struct to simulate named arguments** :

```swift
struct Destination {
    let place: String
}
let drivingWithStruct: (Destination) -> Void = { destination in
    print("I'm going to \(destination.place) in my car")
}
drivingWithStruct(Destination(place: "Los Angeles")) // ✅ Works
```
 
3. **Key Takeaways**  
  - Swift closures allow named **internal**  parameters but not **external**  labels.
 
  - Use a **function**  or **struct**  if you want argument labels when calling.

  - If you’re okay with position-based arguments, closures work fine as they are.
