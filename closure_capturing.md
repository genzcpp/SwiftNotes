In Swift, **closures capture values**  from their surrounding context, which can lead to strong reference cycles if not managed properly. Let's break down how closure capturing works and how to handle it effectively.

---

1. **Value Capture Behavior** 
Closures in Swift can capture variables from their surrounding scope in different ways:
**A. Capturing By Reference (Strong Capture)** By default, closures capture objects (`class` instances) **strongly** , which can lead to memory leaks if a strong reference cycle is created.

```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = {
            print(self.value)  // `self` is strongly captured here!
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
If `self` is referenced inside the closure, the closure **holds a strong reference**  to `self`, preventing the object from being deallocated.

---

**B. Capturing By Value** For **value types**  (`struct`, `enum`), closures **copy**  the value at the time of capture.

```swift
struct Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        var localValue = "Captured!"
        let closure = {
            print(localValue)  // Captures the value at the time of closure creation
        }
        localValue = "Changed"
        closure()  // Prints "Captured!" (not "Changed")
    }
}
```
Here, `localValue` is captured by **value** , so even though it changes afterward, the closure still holds the old value.

    }

        }
        localValue = "Changed"
        closure()  // Prints "Captured!" (not "Changed")
    }
}
```

- `self` is captured **weakly** , meaning it does not increase the reference count.
 
- It becomes an **optional**  (`self?`), so you must unwrap it.


```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = { [weak self] in
            guard let self = self else { return }
            print(self.value)  // `self` is safely unwrapped before use
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
✅ **Best practice**  when `self` can be `nil` at execution time.

- Unlike `weak`, `self` is **not optional**  and doesn't require unwrapping.
 
- **Use this only when you are sure `self` won’t be nil**  when the closure runs.

    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {

        closure()

**A. Capturing By Reference (Strong Capture)** By default, closures capture objects (`class` instances) **strongly** , which can lead to memory leaks if a strong reference cycle is created.

```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = {
            print(self.value)  // `self` is strongly captured here!
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
If `self` is referenced inside the closure, the closure **holds a strong reference**  to `self`, preventing the object from being deallocated.

---

**B. Capturing By Value** For **value types**  (`struct`, `enum`), closures **copy**  the value at the time of capture.

```swift
struct Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        var localValue = "Captured!"
        let closure = {
            print(localValue)  // Captures the value at the time of closure creation
        }
        localValue = "Changed"
        closure()  // Prints "Captured!" (not "Changed")
    }
}
```
Here, `localValue` is captured by **value** , so even though it changes afterward, the closure still holds the old value.

---

2. **In Swift, **closures capture values**  from their surrounding context, which can lead to strong reference cycles if not managed properly. Let's break down how closure capturing works and how to handle it effectively.

---

1. **Value Capture Behavior** 
Closures in Swift can capture variables from their surrounding scope in different ways:
**A. Capturing By Reference (Strong Capture)** By default, closures capture objects (`class` instances) **strongly** , which can lead to memory leaks if a strong reference cycle is created.

```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = {
            print(self.value)  // `self` is strongly captured here!
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
If `self` is referenced inside the closure, the closure **holds a strong reference**  to `self`, preventing the object from being deallocated.

---

**B. Capturing By Value** For **value types**  (`struct`, `enum`), closures **copy**  the value at the time of capture.

```swift
struct Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        var localValue = "Captured!"
        let closure = {
            print(localValue)  // Captures the value at the time of closure creation
        }
        localValue = "Changed"
        closure()  // Prints "Captured!" (not "Changed")
    }
}
```
Here, `localValue` is captured by **value** , so even though it changes afterward, the closure still holds the old value.

---

2. Avoiding Strong Reference Cycles with `[weak self]` and `[unowned self]`** To prevent memory leaks in closures that reference `self`, you can use **weak**  or **unowned**  captures.A. Using `[weak self]`**  
- `self` is captured **weakly** , meaning it does not increase the reference count.
 
- It becomes an **optional**  (`self?`), so you must unwrap it.


```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = { [weak self] in
            guard let self = self else { return }
            print(self.value)  // `self` is safely unwrapped before use
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
✅ **Best practice**  when `self` can be `nil` at execution time.

---

B. Using `[unowned self]`**  
- `self` is captured **unowned** , meaning it assumes `self` will always exist.
 
- Unlike `weak`, `self` is **not optional**  and doesn't require unwrapping.
 
- **Use this only when you are sure `self` won’t be nil**  when the closure runs.


```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = { [unowned self] in
            print(self.value)  // `self` is directly accessed
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
❌ **Danger** : If `self` is deallocated before the closure runs, accessing it will cause a **crash** .

---

3. **Example: Using Closures in Async Code** When using closures in async operations (like network calls), you **must**  handle capturing correctly to avoid memory leaks.✅ Using `[weak self]` in Asynchronous Code** 

```swift
class NetworkManager {
    func fetchData(completion: @escaping () -> Void) {
        DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
            completion()
        }
    }
}

class ViewController {
    var manager = NetworkManager()

    func loadData() {
        manager.fetchData { [weak self] in
            guard let self = self else { return }
            print("Data loaded in \(self)")
        }
    }
}
```
 
- Without `[weak self]`, the closure would **retain**  `self` and cause a memory leak.
 
- With `[weak self]`, `self` is captured weakly and released if no longer needed.


---

**4. Summary** | Capture Type | Use Case | Behavior | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Strong Capture (default) | When you need to ensure the object stays alive | Retains self and can cause memory leaks | 
| [weak self] | When self might be nil at closure execution | Captures self weakly, avoids retain cycles, but requires unwrapping | 
| [unowned self] | When self is guaranteed to exist | Captures self without retaining it, but crashes if self is deallocated |

## capture list

In Swift, the **capture list**  inside the square brackets `[]` allows you to specify how values should be captured in a closure. Aside from `[weak self]` and `[unowned self]`, you can capture other variables in different ways. Here are some useful examples:

---

1️⃣ **Capturing Specific Variables** 
You can explicitly capture and modify variables inside the closure.


```swift
var x = 10

let closure = { [x] in
    print("Captured x: \(x)")  // x is captured by value at the moment the closure is created
}

x = 20
closure()  // Prints: Captured x: 10 (not 20, because it captured the old value)
```
✅ **Useful when you want to "freeze" a value at closure creation.**

class MyClass {

}

var obj: MyClass? = MyClass()
var x = 50

let closure = { [weak obj, x = x * 2] in
    print("Captured obj: \(obj?.value ?? 0), x: \(x)")
}

x = 200  // Changing `x` won't affect the captured value
obj = nil  // The object is deallocated
closure()  // Prints: "Captured obj: 0, x: 100"
```
✅ **Good when you want to capture some variables weakly and others by value.** 

---

🔥 **Summary of Capture List Options** | Capture Type | Example | Behavior | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| [weak self] | [weak self] in | Prevents retain cycles, must be unwrapped | 
| [unowned self] | [unowned self] in | Prevents retain cycles, crashes if self is nil | 
| [x] | [x] in | Captures x by value at closure creation | 
| [x = y * 2] | [x = y * 2] in | Captures a computed value | 
| [weak obj] | [weak obj] in | Weakly captures any object, not just self |

}

x = 20

let capturedX = x  // Store value in a separate variable

let closure = {
    print("Captured x: \(capturedX)")
}

x = 20
closure()  // Prints: Captured x: 10 (same as above)
```
📌 **Key takeaway:**  Declaring `let capturedX = x` before the closure does **something similar** —it stores the value of `x` separately.

---

**2️⃣ When Are They Different?** The capture list has **extra functionality**  beyond just capturing a value.A. Using `[weak self]` or `[unowned self]`**  
- The capture list allows **weak**  or **unowned**  captures, while `let` does not.


```swift
class Example {
    var value = "Hello"
    
    func captureExample() {
        let closure = { [weak self] in
            print(self?.value ?? "self is nil")  // `self` is weakly captured
        }
        closure()
    }
}
```
✅ You **cannot**  achieve this behavior with `let` before the closure.

---

**B. Modifying Captured Variables (Mutable Capture)** The capture list allows **mutable capture** , whereas `let` does not.

```swift
var x = 10

let closure = { [x] in
    var mutableX = x  // x is captured as a separate variable
    mutableX += 5
    print("Modified x inside closure: \(mutableX)")
}

closure()  // Prints: Modified x inside closure: 15
print(x)   // Prints: 10 (original `x` is unchanged)
```
📌 **Why is this special?**  If you used `let x = 10` outside the closure, it wouldn't allow modification inside.

**3️⃣ Key Differences** | Feature | Capture List ([]) | let Before Closure | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Captures values | ✅ Yes, at closure creation | ✅ Yes, before closure execution | 
| Supports weak/unowned | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | 
| Supports mutable capture | ✅ Yes, can be modified inside | ❌ No, let is immutable | 
| Supports object references | ✅ Yes (weak prevents retain cycles) | ✅ Yes, but strongly retained | 


---

**4️⃣ When to Use Which?**  
- ✅ Use **✅ Use capture lists (`[]`)**  when: 
  - You need **weak/unowned self**  to prevent memory leaks.
 
  - You want to capture a variable **as it was at closure creation** .
 
  - You need **mutable capture**  inside the closure.
 
- ✅ Use **✅ Use `let` before the closure**  when: 
  - You just need to store a value **before the closure runs** .

  - You don't need weak references or mutable values.


---

**TL;DR** Capture lists are **not**  exactly the same as using `let` before a closure—they **offer more control**  over how variables are captured, especially for references (`weak`/`unowned`) and mutability.
