When working with **Swift and Objective-C interoperability** , you need to follow specific function naming conventions to ensure seamless interaction between the two languages. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

**1. Naming Conventions for Swift to Objective-C** 
When writing Swift code that will be used in Objective-C, follow these rules:
A. Use `@objc` and `@objcMembers`**  
- Functions and properties that need to be visible in Objective-C should be annotated with `@objc`.
 
- Entire classes can be marked with `@objcMembers`, making all eligible members available.


```swift
import Foundation

@objc class MyClass: NSObject {
    @objc func doSomething() { 
        print("Doing something in Swift") 
    }
    
    @objc func calculateSum(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int { 
        return a + b 
    }
}
```

This will be visible in Objective-C as:


```objc
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
[obj doSomething];
int sum = [obj calculateSumWithA:3 b:5]; // Note the method name transformation
```
**B. Method Name Transformation** 
Swiftâ€™s function names are automatically transformed in Objective-C:
 
- **External parameters become part of the method name.**
 
- `func fetchData(url: String, completion: (Bool) -> Void)` â†’ `fetchDataWithUrl:completion:`
**Example** 

```swift
@objc func fetchData(url: String) { }
```
**Objective-C equivalent:** 

```objc
[obj fetchDataWithUrl:@"https://example.com"];
```

**2. Naming Conventions for Objective-C to Swift** 
When working with Objective-C classes in Swift, naming conventions apply differently.
A. Using `NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT` for Better Swift Naming** Objective-C methods often have verbose names that may not look natural in Swift. Use `NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT` to improve API design.

```objc
@interface MyClass : NSObject
- (void)fetchDataWithURL:(NSString *)url NS_REFINED_FOR_SWIFT;
@end
```
**Swift usage:** 

```swift
let obj = MyClass()
obj.fetchData(url: "https://example.com")
```
**B. Avoid Redundant Prefixes in Swift** Objective-C typically prefixes classes with an abbreviation (`XYZNetworkManager`). In Swift, you donâ€™t need the prefix.

```objc
@interface XYZNetworkManager : NSObject
- (void)startDownload;
@end
```
**Swift:** 

```swift
let manager = NetworkManager() // XYZ prefix is removed automatically
manager.startDownload()
```


---

**3. Customizing Objective-C Method Names in Swift** To manually rename methods for Swift, use `NS_SWIFT_NAME` in Objective-C:

```objc
@interface MyClass : NSObject
- (void)fetchDataWithURL:(NSString *)url NS_SWIFT_NAME(fetchData(url:));
@end
```

Now in Swift, it appears as:


```swift
obj.fetchData(url: "https://example.com")
```

Instead of:


```swift
obj.fetchDataWithURL("https://example.com")
```


---

**4. Handling Swift Initializers in Objective-C** 
Swift initializers donâ€™t automatically get Objective-C support unless explicitly marked.


```swift
@objc class MyClass: NSObject {
    @objc init(value: Int) { } // Required for Objective-C interoperability
}
```

In Objective-C:


```objc
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] initWithValue:42];
```


---

**5. Handling Enums Between Swift and Objective-C**  
- **Swift enums need `@objc` and `Int` raw values to be visible in Objective-C.**
 
- Use `NS_ENUM` in Objective-C for better Swift compatibility.
**Objective-C Enum Example** 

```objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, MyStatus) {
    MyStatusSuccess,
    MyStatusFailure
};
```

Swift will see it as:


```swift
enum MyStatus: Int {
    case success
    case failure
}
```

**Summary of Best Practices** | Scenario | Swift | Objective-C | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Exposing a Swift method to Objective-C | @objc func methodName() | - (void)methodName; | 
| Renaming Swift method in Objective-C | @objc(methodNameInObjC) | - (void)methodNameInObjC; | 
| Objective-C method in Swift | - (void)methodNameWithA:(int)a b:(int)b; | methodName(a:b:) | 
| Custom renaming for Swift | - (void)method NS_SWIFT_NAME(swiftMethod()); | swiftMethod() | 

By following these conventions, you ensure smooth interoperability between Swift and Objective-C. Let me know if you need a specific example! ðŸš€
