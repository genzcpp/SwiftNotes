A **practical use case**  for using `repeat-while` over `while` is when you need to **guarantee that a block of code executes at least once** , regardless of the initial condition.**Example Use Case: User Input Validation** Imagine a scenario where you need to **prompt the user for input**  and ensure it meets certain criteria. You want the prompt to appear **at least once** , and if the input is invalid, ask again.**A **practical use case**  for using `repeat-while` over `while` is when you need to **guarantee that a block of code executes at least once** , regardless of the initial condition.**Example Use Case: User Input Validation** Imagine a scenario where you need to **prompt the user for input**  and ensure it meets certain criteria.

```
Why use `repeat-while`?**  
- The prompt is always displayed **at least once** , even if the first input is already valid.
 
- If the input is invalid, the loop **repeats until**  the condition is met.
 
- `while` wouldn't work well here, because it would require initializing `userInput` beforehand with a valid value or an empty string.

**Another Use Case: Retrying an Operation Until Success** If an operation (like fetching data from a server) should be attempted **at least once**  before checking for success, `repeat-while` is a good choice.**Example: Retrying a Network Request Until Success** 

```swift
var success = false
var attempts = 0

repeat {
    attempts += 1
    print("Attempt \(attempts): Trying to fetch data...")

    // Simulating a random success scenario
    success = Bool.random()

} while !success && attempts < 5

if success {
    print("Data fetched successfully!")
} else {
    print("Failed after 5 attempts.")
}
```

Why use `repeat-while`?**  
- Ensures that the request is **always attempted at least once** .
 
- Automatically retries until either:
  - A successful response is received.

  - A maximum number of attempts is reached.
